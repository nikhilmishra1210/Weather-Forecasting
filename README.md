# Weather-Forecasting
The Weather Forecasting Web Application is a project that provides real-time weather information to users based on their location. 
Technologies Used:

HTML: For creating the structure and content of the web page.
CSS: For styling and layout to enhance user experience.
JavaScript: To add interactivity and handle dynamic content.
REST API: Used to retrieve weather data from a remote server.
The application offers an intuitive interface where users can input their location (e.g., city name or coordinates). After submitting the request, the web page dynamically updates to display the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a short description (e.g., "Partly Cloudy").
